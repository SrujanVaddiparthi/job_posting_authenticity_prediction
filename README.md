# Job Posting Authenticity Detection

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting the authenticity of job postings. With the proliferation of online job portals, ensuring the legitimacy of job postings has become crucial to protect job seekers from fraudulent activities. The model leverages advanced techniques such as Genetic Algorithm optimization, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization to achieve accurate predictions.

## Dataset: 
The model is trained and evaluated on a comprehensive dataset comprising over 9,000 job postings. The dataset includes diverse job postings from various industries and job types, ensuring robust model training and evaluation across different domains.
The datasets are available in the repository.

## Key Features
- Utilizes Genetic Algorithm optimization for hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.
- Implements Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for efficient model optimization and training.
- Leverages TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features for machine learning algorithms.

## Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using standard evaluation metrics, including:
- F1 Score: Measures the balance between precision and recall of the model.
- Accuracy: Indicates the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
- Precision: Measures the model's ability to correctly identify positive cases.
- Recall: Measures the model's ability to capture all positive cases.
